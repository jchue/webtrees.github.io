## Cannot create thumbnails

Creating thumbnail images (i.e. small versions) requires two things.

You can check both using information from the "Server information"
section of the control panel.

Firstly, you need to install a PHP graphics extension.  webtrees can use
either `gd` or `ImageMagick`.

* For `gd`, your server information should include a section `gd`, with an entry `GD support` = `enabled`.

* For `ImageMagick`your server information should include a section `Imagick`, with an entry `ImageMagick supported formats` that includes both `JPEG` and `PNG`.

Secondly, you need sufficient memory.  To decode an image, PHP
requires 4 bytes per pixel.  An image that is 5000 × 4000 pixels will
require 5000 × 4000 × 4 = 80000000 bytes = 80MB.
The rest of the thumbnail script will require approximately 20MB,
so generating this thumbnail will need 80MB + 20MB = 100MB.

Your server's `memory_limit` must be higher than this.

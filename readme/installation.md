# Installation

1. Download the .ZIP file for latest stable version from [github.com](https://github.com/fisharebest/webtrees/releases/latest).
2. Unzip the files and then upload them to an empty folder on your web server.
3. Open your web browser and type the URL for your webtrees site (for example, `http://www.yourserver.com/webtrees`) into the address bar.
4. The webtrees setup wizard will automatically take you through the required steps.

## Setup Wizard

1. Language selection
2. Permission and CPU checks - If there are any problems, they will be listed here.
3. Database selection - Choose from MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server
4. Database connection details - If webtrees will be sharing a database with other applications (or other webtrees installations), you can choose a unique prefix for the tables of this webtrees instance.
5. Administrator account creation

## Create Your First Tree

You will then be redirected to the administrator Control Panel, where your first task is to create a family tree. Enter the tree's title and URL slug.

That's it! Now you can begin building your tree.

If you have a GEDCOM file, you can import it into the tree. If not, just start creating individuals and entering data into your family tree.

## Next steps

There are lots of configuration options. You'll probably want to review the privacy settings first. Don't worry too much about all the other options - the defaults are good for most people. If you get stuck, you can get friendly help and advice from the [Help forum](https://www.webtrees.net/index.php/en/forum/help-for-2-0).

# Backup

Backups are good. Whatever problem you have, it can always be fixed from a good backup.

To make a backup of webtrees, you need to make a copy of the following:

1. The files in the `/data` directory.
2. The tables in the database. Freely available tools such as [phpMyAdmin](http://www.phpmyadmin.net) allow you to do this in one click.
3. If you have custom themes, modules, or other files, or have located your media in a different directory, then be sure to backup those files and folders too.

Remember that most web hosting services do NOT backup your data automatically, and this is your responsibility.

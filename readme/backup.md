# Backup

Backups are good. Whatever problem you have, it can always be fixed from a good backup.

To make a backup of **webtrees**, you need to make a copy of the following

1. The files in the webtrees/data directory.
2. The tables in the database. Freely available tools such as phpMyAdmin allow you to do this in one click.
3. Assuming you have not changed the default, you have successfully backed up your important data, but if you have custom themes, modules or other files, or have located your media in a different directory, then be sure to backup those files and folders too.

Remember that most web hosting services do NOT backup your data, and this is your responsibility.

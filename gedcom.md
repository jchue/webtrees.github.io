title: The GEDCOM data format
---

GEDCOM stands for "GEnealogy Data COMmunciation". It is a file-format used to transfer genealogy data from one application to another.  It was created by the Church Of Latter Day Saints and has since become a standard format used by almost all genealogy applications.

There have been many versions of the GEDCOM standard, and many extensions.  Although officially a draft, the de facto standard is version 5.5.1.

# Features

## Collaboration:

Share your information AND adding or editing it with your relatives around the world. But YOU control who has access and what they can see or do.

## Privacy:

This is a VERY important aspect of putting your Family History on the web. With **webtrees** your data is as secure as you want it to be. Control is configurable at:

- the site level - controlling who can view or register on the site, from anyone down to no-one!
- the family tree level. Each tree you have can be configured differently.
- the user level. You can vary what each registered user can see; whether they can edit data or not; and if you want them to be able to change configurations themselves.
- the individual record level. You can configure webtrees to show only deceased persons data; or everyone; or hide specific individuals; even people who died recently; and much more...
- the "fact" level. This allows you to hide more sensitive facts (such as Social Security Numbers) from everyone except yourself, or any level of access you choose.
- combinations of the above

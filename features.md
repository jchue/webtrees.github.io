## Collaboration

Share information with your relatives around the world and add to or edit it together. But YOU control who has access and what they can see or do.

## Privacy

This is a VERY important aspect of putting your family history on the web. With webtrees your data is as secure as you want it to be. Control is configurable at:

- The site level - Control who can view or register on the site, from anyone to no-one!
- The family tree level - Each tree you have can be configured differently.
- The user level - You can adjust what each registered user can see, whether they can edit data or not, and whether they are able to change configurations themselves.
- The individual record level - You have the option of showing only data of deceased persons, specific individuals, and much more...even hiding people who have died recently.
- The "fact" level - This allows you to hide more sensitive facts (such as Social Security Numbers) from everyone except administrators or any level of access you choose.
- Combinations of the above

## Display pages

On each page you can display media items attached to individuals or specific events in an individuals history. "Media" refers to photos, documents, videos, sound-bites, web links, etc.

## Multimedia

## Maps

## Themes

The standard webtrees package includes six themes (templates) from which to choose. One of those ("colors") has no less than 14 (!) different "color palettes", giving you a total of 19 different styles for your site. You can choose a different one for each family tree and even allow your users to choose their own.

## International Display

By default webtrees is displayed in "International English", but you can choose to enable over 60 other languages. These include US, British, and Australian English; Italian; Polish; Spanish; Finnish; French, and German. Others, including Catalan, Danish, Dutch, Estonian, Hebrew, Hungarian, Norwegian, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Swedish, and Turkish are well developed, and more will be available later.
